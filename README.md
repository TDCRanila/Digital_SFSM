# **Digital's C++ Header-Only Stack-Based Finite State Machine** 
This Finite State Machine utilised State-Based functionality to manage its states. (This type of StateMachine is called an SFSM.) Currently the states have _OnEntry()_, _OnUpdate()_, and _OnExit()_ functionality implemented. The SFSM is written in C++, is **header only** and currently contains out of two files.

## **How to use**
To use the SFSM, the user has to create a StateMachine and the states with functionality.

- Push(); ...
- Pop(); ...
- Clear(); ...
